# Git Implementation: Simplified Class Design

This document outlines the four main classes for a Git-like implementation in Python, grouped by functionality and responsibilities.

---

## 1. `Repository`

### Purpose:
Manages the overall structure and configuration of the Git repository.

### Responsibilities:
- Initialize the repository (`.git` directory).
- Manage configurations (user name, email, etc.).
- Track the repository's current state (e.g., HEAD, branches, refs).

### Example Methods:
- `init()`: Create a new repository.
- `get_config()`: Fetch repository configuration.
- `set_head(ref)`: Update the current HEAD reference.

---

## 2. `Object`

### Purpose:
Represents Git objects (blob, tree, commit, tag).

### Responsibilities:
- Serve as a base class for `Blob`, `Tree`, `Commit`, and `Tag`.
- Handle serialization and deserialization of objects.
- Compute and verify SHA-1 hashes.
- Store object-specific data:
  - **Blob**: File content.
  - **Tree**: Directory structure.
  - **Commit**: Metadata (message, parent, author).
  - **Tag**: Marks specific commits.

### Example Methods:
- `serialize()`: Convert object data to a binary format.
- `deserialize(data)`: Parse binary data into an object.
- `compute_hash()`: Calculate the SHA-1 hash for the object.

---

## 3. `Index`

### Purpose:
Represents the staging area (index file).

### Responsibilities:
- Track files staged for the next commit.
- Add or remove files from the index.
- Compare the working directory with the index and repository to detect changes.

### Example Methods:
- `add(file_path)`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `remove(file_path)`: Remove a file from the staging area.
- `status()`: Show changes between the working directory and the index.

## 4. `Command`

### Purpose:
Implements Git commands and workflows.

### Responsibilities:
- Execute operations like `init`, `add`, `commit`, `checkout`, etc.
- Manage user-facing commands and interact with the repository, objects, and index.

### Example Methods:
- `run(command, args)`: Execute a Git-like command.
- `commit(message)`: Create a new commit.
- `checkout(ref)`: Switch to a specific branch or commit.

## Class Relationships

1. **`Repository`**:
   - Manages `Object`, `Index`, and `Command`.
   - Provides access to the `.git` directory and configuration.

2. **`Object`**:
   - Stores and retrieves Git objects (blobs, trees, commits, tags).

3. **`Index`**:
   - Stages changes and prepares files for commits.

4. **`Command`**:
   - Acts as the interface for executing Git-like commands (`add`, `commit`, etc.).
