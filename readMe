This project is designed to help you understand how GitHub and version control systems (VCS) work under the hood. The instructions provided will guide you through running the project using **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on a Windows machine. Compatibility with macOS and Linux is not guaranteed, but feel free to try!
